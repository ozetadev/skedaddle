This app aims to hit all assigned points for the project.

  - Google Places: I use the Google Places API to auto-fill information in the routing text fields, as well as calculating geometry
  - Connect to an API of some form (ex: weather API): I connect to the Uber pricing API, to show the user the alternative (insane) Uber pricing
  - Autocomplete using at least two data sources: I autocomplete in the location field from the Google Places API, as well as [add second source]
  - Some form of a ticket or pass, with an animation: When you "buy" your ticket, you get a QR code ticket encoded with
    the Date & Time, as well as the start and end points, and a randomly generated ID. Code obfuscated by animation.


A few points:
  - I apologize for the lack of unit testing, and error handling. Normally this would obviously be done, but with the time allotted I wanted to hit all the required points well.
  - I am a 5+ year Objective-C veteran. I am intimately familiar with Cocoa Touch and UIKit. This is legitimately my first time using Swift for real. If I have one real talent, it is learning quickly.
